( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684868%28v=vs.85%29.aspx ), so to keep things in the same thread, the process HANDLE should be opened from the process id before the service is stopped, and the Wait should be done after that.

					// Response to EDIT: What you report is true, but the problem is that the handle isn't actually opened by Process.GetProcessById. It's only opened within the .WaitForExit method, which won't return until the wait is complete. Thus, if we try the wait on the current therad, we can't actually do anything until it's done, and if we defer the check until after the process has completed, it won't be possible to obtain a handle to it any more.

					// The actual wait, using process.WaitForExit, opens a handle with the SYNCHRONIZE
					// permission only and closes the handle before returning. As long as that handle
					// is open, the process can be monitored for termination, but if the process exits
					// before the handle is opened, it is no longer possible to open a handle to the
					// original process and, worse, though it exists only as a technicality, there is
					// a race condition in that another process could pop up with the same process ID.
					// As such, we definitely want the handle to be opened before we ask the service
					// to close, but since the handle's lifetime is only that of the call to WaitForExit
					// and while WaitForExit is blocking the thread we can't make calls into the SCM,
					// it would appear to be necessary to perform the wait on a separate thread.
